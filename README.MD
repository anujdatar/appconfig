# appconfig

Node module to save app configuration files in the home folder. This module is based on [conf](https://github.com/sindresorhus/conf) but avoids use of `atomic-file-write` and `mkdir`. Because of issues with chown permission error with Snaps.

## Usage

This is still in beta

```bash
npm install @anujdatar/appconfig@next
```
